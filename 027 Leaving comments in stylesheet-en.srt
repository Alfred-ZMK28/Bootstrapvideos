1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,860
And the one thing I want to tell you is you can always comment just like with comment.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:16,780
We know how to comment the statement do you comment like this the end is coming in since this is just

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,230
to

4
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,020
begin.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,380
This is how you can comment and read.

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,600
This is for.

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,610
So this is how you can comment.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,860
So it's easier for you to later come back and fix things.

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,730
This is for men.

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,140
So these are where you can leave and say is this.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,350
So I was going to do is I was going to

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,320
do.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,130
Did you through first.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,670
Awesome actually let's fix this do this wearing this thing.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,620
I know my kid.

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,410
So what's the name of this class writer for the first

17
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,860
Ronald Reagan to in the back.

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,270
Again this was

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,330
guards in the courtroom.

20
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,360
And we can always give Michael that's a big issue.

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,910
You can even get minus value or something if you need minus value.

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
You know that is a big issue.

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,070
That's.

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,650
Jean

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:05,920
5 2 3 2 0 0 0

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,300
being only right 0 9 didn't break the eggs.

27
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,630
It's always

28
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:30,980
great and it's good brand name brand.

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,920
So as you can see right after these buttons we have the anger takes a brand name on and it's call it

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,170
all you want to call it.

31
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,040
It's called

32
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,410
that.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,910
I mean is a brand and it's links

34
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,700

butcher good.

38
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,700
The next next let's make them actual links are.

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,190
So let's begin with that.

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,620
No way.

41
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,630
And when we get here because we can't even make it go to the next Facebook.

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,360
Let's keep it yeah let's let's see what we can do with this.
