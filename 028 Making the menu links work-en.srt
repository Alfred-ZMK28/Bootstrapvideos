1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,530
OK so let's make these links clickable.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,270
All right.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,260
So you clicking Contact I want to reach to desex and contact you get them services may be destroyed

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,990
or services or things arguments.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,750
So not index file didn't you collapse this.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,670
So the first thing you want to do is let's fix this contact from where it click on the contact form.

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,880
We want to get to this.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,520
So let's send these two up on deck.

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,310
And then let's this contact from this whole thing is inside this room.

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,740
All right.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:01,900
So let's get this wrong idea let's give you the idea of contact.

12
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,430
Right.

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,980
So if you do just this like this is being called a deadline.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,730
So if you do that this is good for testing when you're developing.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:22,050
So when you do this today as we get to the same position as the skeletons.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,230
So we come back to the same place and nothing happens.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,210
Instead we going to use compter to the ID when people click on this link.

18
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,630
The reference is it can be like I saw the URL it can be some of those sites you know things like that

19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,560
but in our case it does the idea of contact.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,970
So once this is clicked on we're looking for a device with the idea of contact.

21
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,350
And if we find here

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,890
this way you get the idea of context and that's how it works.

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:12,100
Say it could reverse the biz and if you click will be taken straight to contact for you isn't it.

24
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:24,960
You can even give these takes to pass how you do that legs so the earlier buttons they have Button button

25
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,210
primary button danger but shucks has been in for all that.

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,680
And they're different colors so you can use the same format here.

27
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:45,180
You can say text instead of button primary you say text from here you know and see that the primer the

28
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,980
send button call you got this same color here.

29
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,390
We're going to use this to make it capsular but I'm seeing the hard coded numbers simply

30
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,510
weren't there.

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
And I said

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,180
you're

33
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:23,470
horizontal you are I really like present my simple and elegant beautiful.

34
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,980
All right.

35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,750
So contact for me got.
