1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,680
Hokus let's add a background image for with a fixed background image to start with this section.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,660
So the first thing that's good to our services.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:21,460
DB The one that may collapse this one.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,000
This one is blockquote.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,060
Let me collapse this as well.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,910
And this is the table that collapsed this

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,030
this is from

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,610
and this is the services.

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,510
This is normally interested in working.

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,130
So

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,080
it has that idea of services like.

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,350
So let's use this idea.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,800
We don't need all these guys who can use ideas will submit.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,880
Let's use the copy

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:23,930
and let's try it so we can use this because we use the data with ID has services.

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:31,090
And what we want to do is in this deal with the class name ID name services we want to use the background

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,050
image.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,230
So there is a serious class for using background images which is as you go Simmons's background color

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,770
is back on Amy's background.

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,120
And then we supply the you again your parenthesis.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,090
And inside we give the address in double quotation marks.

22
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,920
So let's do that for you don't you.

23
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,950
Insert image is.

24
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,990
And there is a beautiful

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,370
right.

26
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,760
That's good.

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,870
Some more images.

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,290
Yeah I was not sure I know it looks no.

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,180
No it's

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,430
cute it's it's

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,030
so it is taking just enough space for this content.

32
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,140
If you have bigger more content it looks great.

33
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,370
So this is all we want at the moment.

34
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,190
It looks actually pretty good with this deep blue it and slowly and light.

35
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,900
It's good.

36
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,110
What I'm going to do is reduce the margin so that it's going to act as it's designed by a margin of

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,970
two or three beats

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,990
and there's 20 for tonight.

39
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,650
And that's 30 over

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,100
that salute beautiful.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,400
And we can also give a thing so that when you scrub the image stays fixed.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,130
And when you scroll up and down it gives kind of a very nice effect as if the content is moving whereas

43
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,620
image is not.

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:56,900
So let's hope it does.

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,080
And let's make it fixed.

46
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,800
You know you see Zunes

47
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,440
see heads

48
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:25,660
and you know as you can see when I'm scrolling to the background stays the same only the content changes

49
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,930
her that that's awesome.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,010
Let's make it bigger.

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,550
Let's make this the

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,730
506.

53
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,880
That's beautiful.

54
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,350
On to or play some she's just 36 and has two different suits in the middle.

55
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,700
It looks pretty neat.

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,400
Pretty good.

57
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,700
Now we're focusing the images very well.

58
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:05,120
That's Austin de the content.

59
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,500
Let's give this.

60
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,280
So this is the one retargeting But this device which holds all the content lets you read a class name

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,660
its last name of

62
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,050
content.

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:39,610
So I was just going to see the score with this one so that it could be you know scissors.

64
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,480
And then the one we just created is this will be this one first.

65
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:57,190
And as you can see it means it's not there something you have Also what are done here as you can see

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,230
that there is a bit of a building on top and bottom and this text is center.

67
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,080
So I see that using these services.

68
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,370
So let me actually copy this

69
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,710
in without this.

70
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:23,470
It looks like this as we saw it earlier but as soon as you apply this this is as you can see how black

71
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,170
the bally on top and bottom.

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,510
You can even write like this reading it right up right left.

73
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,910
You can even do this.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,950
So it applies on top and bottom and then the second same thing is for the right and left right and left

75
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,290
as I to leave it there as it is.

76
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:55,410
So this will this is this we have the center content of the applied bit of betting top and bottom and

77
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:04,740
Geraint right and left and we got these styling which is as in the bag on e-mails.

78
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,700
There was one issue which I fixed and I think my wriggling was of that time.

79
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,520
So I just want to show you how to fix that when I move.

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,720
That is why I was using there live.

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,970
It was working fine but as soon as I move it didn't work.

82
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,520
So if I leave it just like this let me just say that before we were trying like this right.

83
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,470
So if you go first as you'll see the image is gone.

84
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,890
That's because when you actually play it and CIRCE's stylesheet what happens is it has to follow by

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
a domain.

86
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,840
So it in NHL website when you push whoosh out to the live show you'll have the domain name.

87
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,290
And then there will be a full name.

88
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,490
So you'll have my domain dot com Sless images.

89
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,820
So there's no way in all that but because we work locally and this is the actual path we need the index

90
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,910
obviously but this is the destination of our for that route.

91
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,080
So this is the one I copy and paste here.

92
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,200
So on the user I pull that up to the bootstrap which is the form and then Emacs's and then then does

93
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:25,600
just fix that up and then you should be glad to the.

94
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,180
Everything is already.

95
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,180
So this is it for this lesson.

96
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,960
Show you one more thing in terms of design and background with images and all this stuff I would say

97
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,490
one would think that is adding the gradient background which is awesome.

98
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:49,490
So probably will head black to slowly fading to work in the next video.

99
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,270
Thank you very much.
