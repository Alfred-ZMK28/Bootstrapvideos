1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,320
All of them it starts with fire.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,160
And I can I'm going to use this for the moment but you can always give it a unique class name if you

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:18,340
want to you know or by the individual because it will be easier later on because I try to do it or be

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,250
lazy and do it again.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,830
My I go that's them and like them my work.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,940
This is the Kostner see.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,210
So all of these icons have the same class in my icon.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,620
And now I'm going to apply the styling to my I can apply to all these items with this class name.

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,250
And later if we create more class and we want to have the same effect we can simply apply this in that

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,580
that's it.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,970
So let's try that.

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,410
So this one we're going to copy paste you know later and now let's try this.

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:19,960
I can in here let's give them a bigger bigger size and size 50 piece.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,850
I think you need to save this file for us and then rephrase this please.

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,040
So just so that I don't lose this competition.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,950
This is Furr's history.

17
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:45,690
And as you can see as soon as our blog says it says beautiful 50 pictures that looks good this could

18
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,200
be Sewanee or you can do this in not center.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,620
So let's let's make it Center.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,740
And that's pretty easy we would sir.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,930
We can do this syndrome with the text.

22
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,020
So the whole deal is centered on the content.

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:14,180
Corporatists are going to lose it for as you can see its center as soon as I applied this thing.

24
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,130
It is Saenger beautiful.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,880
OK so the next thing is now we're going to copy this.

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,070
She this is put in our style.

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,110
So it is really easy to do it live right.

28
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,560
This is a great blog and copy this is.

29
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,790
And we're going to put it in our own studies.

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,970
Now I think we don't have one yet.

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,010
Head style bootstrap would serve we don't have our let's create our link and head Tref Let's create

32
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,130
my Sternbergh see it says.

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,840
It's clear to insert these nice timers you find

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,240
we.

35
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:24,030
And based on that we tried earlier say we should press and beautiful.

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:33,040
So that's how we learn how to use front on some items and we learn how to use our own system.

37
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,950
Awesome.

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,980
All right.

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,750
So we'll do more in the next lesson.

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,520
Thank you very much.
