1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,300
As you can see there's a slight difference because once you apply a Jumbotron it gives a different from

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,530
styling and all of this.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,050
And then the normal one looks very different.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,940
So know we can always override this what looks pretty great at the moment that's the benefit of using

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,800
too much fun.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,250
So make it stand out.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,650
So that's good.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:30,350
So we have image we have the text now this in now let's say let's let's imagine that it was web based

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:30,980
forums.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,070
Travel Agent or travel site or something like that so maybe we want to show something is a button that

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,490
says Book.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,400
Book 2 or something like that.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,390
How do you do that.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,480
It's it's pretty straightforward with words so it's really easy to create beautiful buttons.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,960
Let me show you one.

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,460
We have a paragraph and after this paragraph let's say we only queried about some bottom up.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:08,440
We are always open and close the bottom to the button and then said Here let's get to class without

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,880
class them let's have a look at it

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,170
too.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,940
So this is how it looks without class any class.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,940
And this is already using words so it doesn't look this good as it doesn't look that good.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,370
But let's play some would show us

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,380
let's give it a class name of button always you actually start with button and then button dust's primary

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,800
and there are many different classes in there.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,640
They have I think six class names they call primary danger that has a red color.

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,040
That's danger.

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,490
Another one is sukses.

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,330
Another one is there are quite a lot.

29
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,830
We can have a look at them.

30
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:08,440
One prominent one such info and their stuff like that we can come back to it later.

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,450
Let's let's these folks in this modern primary.

32
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,740
Let's have a look how it looks for first.

33
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,390
And as you can see spiritually as well Joe Johns is learning.

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,650
And that looks beautiful.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,220
Organ.

36
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,000
So this far it's looking good.

37
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,210
Let's let's continue this one.

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,550
The next thing let's create some lists.

39
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,670
What to do it because I'm all human small screen.

40
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,260
I'm going to collapse this as soon as I can see the whole way and see this.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,530
He's clicking this arrow and it collapses again.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,480
So we have the mindif contained a fluid inside that we are working with this inside this row.

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,050
Great.

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,320
Another day.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,600
And let's create do clone more

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,420
and we want to create some list dives right.

47
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,260
Ordered lists.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:32,980
Page three Weren't you the most memorable takes center here.

49
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,680
Some creation.

50
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:49,250
So at least we do know the list you know and then that would serve as a class name for this class list

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,040
group

52
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,780
and waiting list would call you of interest group.

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,380
Right.

54
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,900
And so yeah.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,580
So it started with a list group and then group item.

56
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,500
So want to get it straight after after a while you'd be comfortable with this.

57
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,230
And let's create some

58
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:48,330
looks the first and you can see the list is rendered beautifully how good it looks.

59
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,280
Let's make it a bit more interesting.

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,050
Let's make it.

61
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,700
All I wanna do is I don't want it destroyed all the way from here to here from right to left.

62
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,490
I want it to be somewhere in the Middle East here in the center.

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,830
So how do you do that.

64
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,170
Let me say we have to deal with the code taking the full with trust.

65
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,050
So instead of what I can do is I can put all these elements inside another column.

66
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,800
Let's copy that so that we can this.

67
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,500
Let's create some divs Let's create call them.

68
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,960
In fact I would say easily.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,820
OK.

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,300
So we had we have these we'll call them grid.

71
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,920
What I'm going to do is I'm going to use only six.

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,290
And what about the rest of the six because we have to always make it to work.

73
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:50,020
So what are you going to do is call them small or set free.

74
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:58,640
Now what this really do is it will take the six call and then the rest of the both the right and left

75
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,340
side it will offset three.

76
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,190
So on the right three on the left three it will offset.

77
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,940
So right 3 and three six plus six.

78
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,550
So that's how it works so now that our content will be centralized center in the middle and it will

79
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,630
have the offshoot columns 3 and 3 on both side.

80
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:32,450
So we are as you can see here this side of offered 3 3 kobun this side of it in the middle six column

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,470
and it is taking place we the.

82
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,880
So this is how you can use both circuits really form and we can do a lot more.

83
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,020
We're going to be very creative with this.

84
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,200
So we'll do more with bootstrap in the next video.

85
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,210
Thank you.
