1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:07,030
Or let's continue with farms would farms are one of the best features of the woodshed.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,410
It's really easy to work with forms.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,210
So what are you going to do is let's create some forms and submit

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:28,850
it so we have this div let's collapse this as well let's quit.

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,990
Did you.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:36,900
The

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,550
paint as an asset to

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,660
farms in Bootstrap.

9
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,520
It's creative.

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:17,480
To name some form of control that's a bootstrap class inside.

11
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,800
Instead we created.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,230
You form with a class name form control.

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:34,440
And we created did we get a last name of form group and instead of let's call it

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:48,200
name that we call the let's call it the and then field text

15
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,730
class will the form control.

16
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,020
So we created we didn't need to do with any.

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,330
We just create a form and then inside form we create a DB.

18
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:18,480
The first DB will have in full field of in-fill filled with the type of text and it will have a label

19
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,060
called names so people understand what it's about.

20
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,590
Let's do the same.

21
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:31,280
It's copy and paste mean email Prosor.

22
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,960
You go to

23
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,490
I

24
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,810
got the last word don't last for.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,730
And finally let's create I'M BORED BORED BORED.

26
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:05,670
For all those you named some literary

27
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,300
looks pretty good.

28
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,840
So we have fun and people can fill in the name.

29
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,290
E-mail us or as you can see we are Blagden Embassador so it doesn't it obviously.

30
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:28,750
So it has and then comes name and possibly comes and submit.

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,170
No it looks a bit odd.

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,030
That's because wasn't in full.

33
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,690
Now let's try it here.

34
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,290
That's prober.

35
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,170
So this is how it looks.

36
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,190
Looks pretty good.

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,240
Prom's in Butcher really easy and beautiful.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,020
How about the one we did here.

39
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,870
We have the radio button checkbox.

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,450
Let's try them out too.

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,640
Let's do that.

42
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,650
Let's do the same.

43
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:04,390
So let's create another deep.

44
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:12,570
We don't need the input fill in soon to have them here label and then we will put you in put.

45
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:12,880
Type

46
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,510
said.

47
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,470
It's you name so names should be in the label.

48
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,960
This is just the input field name we can call it what are we going to call it.

49
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,690
It's going to be

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,420
one.

51
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,760
So people are going to say this is the same for worry about

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:53,920
you

53
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,470
and me

54
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,360
Ray.

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,650
So this is how easy it is to work with friends in books.

56
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,810
And now we can give a different class name to buttons.

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,990
We can give

58
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,660
success and looks different.

59
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:36,670
We already tried primary here so is and begin doing x ray.

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,030
And that's that's how it works.

61
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,800
We learn how to create a function which is pretty cool.

62
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,350
And we do more stuff in the next lesson.
