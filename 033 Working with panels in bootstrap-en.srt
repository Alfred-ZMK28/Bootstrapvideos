1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,520
Let me quickly show you how you can create panels it's really good.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,570
One of my favorite reason to go to the end of our documentary.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,680
It's great.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,740
Believe they can turn you into an intern.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,990
I want to make sure it

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,330
does and then I will create three columns.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,490
Column.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,350
As for and

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,100
dear in this column I will create a deal with a class name.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:01:00,410
Did you then did the board start heading inside this pen with a class name of default.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,870
I would create 3:6 and three days heading body and for I guess it did.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,850
In the deep

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,540
and then

14
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:32,170
Cruger or to deep panel heading let's say hate you

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,740
mean the body

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,670
threads and then you let's work

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,690
your lips

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,260
on so see how it looks looks good.

19
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:17,010
The reason doesn't look that good for this time is heading to me.

20
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:24,690
Let's use his three because we used to many different ways to and from the get go.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,980
Looks more realistic.

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:38,490
All right or just go to the heading panel footer that's where the bottom button Bartonville Frist and

23
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,930
you can see that's cool.

24
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,750
So this how you going to quit.

25
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,900
So this is the first pen let me copy this plan.

26
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:55,520
This is called small one copy.

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
That looks beautiful and you can add icons here on the side.

28
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,390
You can do a lot of things.

29
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,080
The one we did use the food is this this is great.

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:21,130
Using icons really really gives the dynamics for our context of importance and you can quickly certain

31
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,010
juggling decks using the command.

32
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,370
If you follow the rules then these Kunbi

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,050
and that's it.

34
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,390
Damn

35
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:58,120
the first thing I collapsed early and here in this bottom you can it's been done.

36
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,820
So it's more readable.

37
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,330
You can add the button.

38
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:11,350
I can be far more in the Friends Big

39
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,640
B is my can we in that class.

40
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,440
That should come back here.

41
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,860
So that's how you can customize and make the cost you can use that.

42
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,300
First for the items and you can use whatever things you don't have to homes.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:48,650
In his bottom muskeg from his work.

44
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,280
So nice to see the difference now.

45
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,260
It looks pretty good.

46
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,790
I guess so.

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,070
It's a bit of a pattern for this.

48
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:07,740
David looks to cause DVD current in a fluid and

49
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:10,820
my

50
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,540
name doesn't conflict.

51
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,530
DAVID

52
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,940
I don't know let's try it.

53
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,490
Let's try this my balance.

54
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:34,110
And then I betting 50 bucks or so and 60.

55
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,580
So it's really good.

56
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,230
You can see my copy.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,920
This now to be here.

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,760
All right.

59
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,190
So this is how we can work with the books.

60
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,610
It's amazing.

61
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,730
You can see we have navigation we have Jumbotron We have immense restaurants everything is restaurants.

62
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,940
Beautiful.

63
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,060
Awesome.

64
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,860
Again it's looking very good.

65
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,240
Use this blog we use the strong day and night.

66
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,040
I keep emphasizing this summer I didn't want to miss that again.

67
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,010
The tables we got to actually get right are things you are.

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,100
We have friends awesome buttons again so we need nearly there.

69
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,530
The next thing I'm going to do is the last thing and cool thing there is also how to use Aquarians.

70
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:45,820
So your drummer turns you look awesome and I will also show you how to use the bagong e-mails for your

71
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,390
JumboTron is full with.

72
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,820
All right.

73
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,160
So that's that's coming next.

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Thank you very much.
