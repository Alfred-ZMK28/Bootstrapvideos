1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:10,160
Are going to be starting decree I want to show you what an absolutely amazing thing that it is.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,020
We'll start out I really love it.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,140
This is amazing.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,650
It's good to well and good with the schools that they have.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,100
As you can see Greek to open more when you click in something like that pops up.

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,920
Cool right.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,000
It's let's let's use this Curtiz.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,410
Let's go have a look at the code.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,330
So what they have here is pretty standard here.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,380
They have a tag they have a deal and this deal has this button.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,410
This button gives the data total model and data target is the model the same as we did earlier with

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,150
navigation and all that.

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,110
So the same way.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:13,110
So we have a deal with a model with the idea of class Fred and then we have the two different divs with

15
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,850
buttons one has for closing and then we have the header we have the body six.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,840
And we have the button.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,620
It's pretty standard.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,730
So let's take these example and try it out.

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,140
Gourley starts here.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,600
And then let's go with the compre

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,460
scorpion is also quite a skill in.

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,400
Which is really helpful.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,930
And nothing wrong with that.

24
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,700
Everyone does the same thing because you can use

25
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:05,600
the Sablon plugin for that without one for you without them.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:15,150
So they didn't have to always go there and Kope you can generate things kind of like let's say bootstrap

27
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,040
3.

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,840
And as you can see it get all the the mark up.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:32,550
However I will say the next how will you do this but for the moment let's say that in say it and that's

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,260
how it is at the end moral example open and open up how good is that.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,020
That's awesome.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,890
All right.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:03:18,900
So let's let's make it Center in lets make sense to modern Hedger like Zandu.

34
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,050
All right let's leave it let's keep it a double.

35
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,280
This is

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,880
a lot of copy based here but I'm sure you got the point.

37
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,270
It is necessary are you patient.

38
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,020
There's a better way would say next but there's no point in writing line by line.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,770
It's just a lot of time and saved lives.

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,620
And as you can see we have the model.

41
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,940
It's a bit of a digital and we can a better.

42
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,930
What is the name of this model.

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,370
DB It's called Murder box.

44
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,810
This

45
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,040
50 piece.

46
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:30,980
Called

47
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,790
it first and that was all right.

48
00:04:50,600 --> 00:05:00,830
So we can use this we can use this to create Let's say we can even pull this contact from inside the

49
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,320
murder.

50
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,980
So you can simply say contact us.

51
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,680
And then when people click on the Contact Us they will get this contact.

52
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,970
That would be awesome right.

53
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,950
So you can be creative and do a lot of stuff.

54
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,010
And let's see what we would be doing in the future once we get into degree.

55
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,880
Maybe we'll do some things with this model or maybe not.

56
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,130
Let's see but as you can see this is really cool.

57
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,980
OK so let's let's wrap it up let's wrap this with subsects.

58
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:40,950
We learn quite a lot and I hope you really enjoyed it and then definitely again we're amazing were business

59
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:48,770
responsive fluorescent spaces and bootstrapped you once you have reached this far and practice a few

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,560
times and I'm sure you love practicing because it's honest fun.

61
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,160
It's so much fun.

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,450
All right.

63
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,190
Thank you very much.

64
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,390
And I will meet in the next six and with Dick Gregory.

65
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,810
Thank you.
