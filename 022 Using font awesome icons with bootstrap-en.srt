1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,280
In this lesson I want to show you how we can study using foreign awesome icons.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,270
They are the most popular eigenstate and they really really change the way your web site looks.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,750
It's really important going to be very creative with those arguments.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:22,910
Let's get them in this time I'm going to use CD and people but I didn't use Sirian but this time I will

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,520
use and so you know how to use that too.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,380
So sing songs for CD.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,120
We can download it onto their site.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,260
And so you want them to is the site

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,280
you can download and link the same way we did with butcher.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,200
Are you can to sit in let me use the N

11
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,050
and copy this for farmers.

12
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,490
But she is copy

13
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,090
expensive.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,580
Nobody should have to use.

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,440
Let's try let's try.

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,120
So this is our first deal.

17
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,090
You.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,540
This is a first day.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,780
Let's put right after this.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,210
I want to create a deal with a treat called Groote just to see.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:45,030
So after the first did they quit and quit and deal with Colomb small.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:54,610
And inside this deal I create a 3D with 4 4 4 4 4 inch deep comb.

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,270
Paul

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,950
let's call it.

25
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,540
So is Dave let's say let's let's put some I can for sure that we can see.

26
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,940
Let's good to find awesome.

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,980
So Ian I was going from here ording.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,270
I'm going to do is good icons on top and then I can certify it and instead of looking at it and then

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,560
it is to do some research.

30
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,950
Let's let's put some like like this.

31
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,650
This is like any good.

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,180
It's these absence.

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,910
Let's try this time.

34
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:46,980
Clicking this one and you can see fit to use this we have to use this class name for fun.

35
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,960
Awesome.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,020
A sense of fun.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,540
Awesome awesome desk.

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,930
Thumbs up to that.

39
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,430
And is it too soon to copy that.

40
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,850
And then we want to put it in this dibber.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,030
So let's play it here.

42
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,940
And let's let's take another one.

43
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,210
Another one word works.

44
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,270
Let's say it's one of these let's say infl

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,640
fool.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,270
There are nine

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,130
How about first sir.

48
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,560
What is this.

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,930
Info let's see is this

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
Corbie could.

51
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,270
And in the second do you.

52
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:56,600
Yeah let's try one more let's try this.

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,980
Travis

54
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,660
these I consumed all of you really.

55
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,470
And here they get you.

56
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,760
OK.

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,550
Now that's good for us and see we've got the Titans.

58
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,630
Beautiful.

59
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,270
Now let's use our custom styling to make them look awesome.

60
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,460
Let's make them bigger.

61
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,650
Give them color things like that.

62
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,940
Let's do that.

63
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,050
So we need to first need to create our style.

64
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,520
Right.

65
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,360
We don't have our styles idiot.

66
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,050
We are only using bootstrap.

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,950
So let's let's do that let's do that in the next list.

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,390
Thank you.
