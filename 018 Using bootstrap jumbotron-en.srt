1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,190
This let's have a look at all sides.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:12,920
OK so we had the main text and then we had a bit of a description with the horizontal.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,380
Let's try to recreate the same thing with bootstrap and we will add more later on.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,250
So

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:36,790
let's call her horizontal line and then let's create a better some dummy did not mean text it looks.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,890
See her in the mirror.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,740
Beautiful So as you can see bootstrap is taking place.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,490
It looks around looks much better.

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:58,770
So we created the content seconds and we created a row internal to do with the cause of trub.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:08,560
What if we want to send to the text we can use obviously we can use this style she has this our own

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,750
she says.

12
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,710
But with woodchip it's really all you have to do is because you want to send to this deal the content

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,710
of this deal.

14
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,790
You want to center in the square.

15
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:30,250
So all you do is text the sender even if it is not a text you can use this class name and that will

16
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:38,320
send to the content of this device say with friends and you can see it's center.

17
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,720
That's how whatsapp works.

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,760
It's all about using bootstrap class names to make our life a lot easier and building fully responsive

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,470
beautiful web with Bass's are all about giving you the background color just like this.

20
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,420
Let's get you to back up again and bootstrap for that.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,390
It's pretty easy.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,490
Woodchip has a class name it's called jumbotron

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,510
and what it does it gives a just like the name Jumbo and it creates a bit of a background with bare

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,500
padding with mice and these that are also out for you all these most useful class names.

25
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,220
So don't get overwhelmed don't.

26
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,970
Don't worry.

27
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,450
How are you going to remember all these classes.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:43,370
Just the ones that I cover in this course will make you pretty much ready to build almost anywhere best.

29
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,460
So once you get busy once you start building a couple of projects you'll be good.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,260
You'll be really comfortable.

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:03:00,930
So it's not nice to call them truckle grade send the text and then we apply this let's see how it looks.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,590
The first

33
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:16,150
different that we can we use the spirit of programming Jumbotron for how beautiful it looks.

34
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,090
It's amazing isn't it.

35
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,450
That's the beauty of bootstrap.

36
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,320
So this is how we can see the change as soon as you apply Jumbotron.

37
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,050
Beautiful.

38
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,070
How about making it full with especially on the top of the base.

39
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,170
That look really good.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,030
If we freehand make it full with.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,270
So we didn't do that just by sending the class name again.

42
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,750
So previously I said content but content also we have one more option for that content fluid.

43
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,530
Once your blood contains a fluid what it does is fluids.

44
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,740
It stretches the entire screen.

45
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,790
So let let's try it out for us.

46
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,690
And as you can see it stretches the whole screen looks beautiful now.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,300
All right.

48
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,990
So that's exciting isn't it.

49
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:24,330
This is beautiful the words were but it's really really fun to work with and makes her life a lot easier

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,550
and we can create beautiful pages in no time.

51
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,000
All right.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
More in the next lesson.

53
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:29,980
