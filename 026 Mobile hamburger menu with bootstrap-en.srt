1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,270
So we have our menu which looks pretty good but the problem is when we make it small it looks good but

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880
when we click it doesn't work.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,260
So how do we fix that.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,500
For that to work we need to include javascript which haven't included yet.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,620
So what you have is when we downard would serve obviously we got the days folder and inside this folder

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,920
we have bootstrap the data is all we can use manufacturers.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,720
So we have to link to one of these and we can.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,900
We need to use Indic query as well.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:51,320
So let me hard decide what I'm going to do is all these scripts put it right before the end of the body

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,160
so that the page renders pretty well.

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,530
And then the script or otherwise it will delay the learning process of the base.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,840
So always keep it right before the end of the body type of a script.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the include the script for booths for

14
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,690
these service is.

15
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,320
So Sanjay is less mature.

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,780
Yes.

17
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,130
Yes.

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,010
Yes that's right.

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,200
And we are in a crucial period that we can get that degree is meaningful.

20
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,310
Let's take the minute that was in the

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,700
here

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,000
and you can do the same for Bush.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,610
So you can include from Sealion but since we have always done let's use that word is easy to use from

24
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,320
the scene.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,270
It's pretty good.

26
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,520
It's fast for folks inside as well.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:15,170
Let's let's see if it works for us.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,380
Let's use from Syria and so they agree.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,990
And so we are using both from Syria and latest compile and in hindsight was Kovi was probably an Egan

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,250
day.

31
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,030
All these so you don't even have to worry world.

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,210
But let's try this again sir.

33
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:49,160
So we included the query from the CDC and we included bootstrap javascript also from the official side

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,070
city.

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,810
And we put it right before our task.

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,290
Now let's try if it works for us.

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,010
Small and beautiful works beautifully.

38
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,410
That's awesome.

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,700
That is what we can do next.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,410
Let's actually let's treat this styling.

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,440
The one we had here this one so let's switch to ZDF and see how it works.

42
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,730
Remember that

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,250
for some we are already using machine that's fine.

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:36,550
And the only local stylesheet is this hour my style and everything we use from the CD.

45
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,660
I mean let's try to dig more with the team.

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,750
I think that's the

47
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,250
it's

48
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,180
head Six looks a bit messy but it's not going to be worth it just the links for she didn't from the

49
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,460
officials.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,190
Now friends.

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,170
All right.

52
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,040
Yeah.

53
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,290
Everything looks perfectly beautiful.

54
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,950
Now one more thing I want to fix is I really like these curved curved thing here.

55
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,920
I want to make it straight.

56
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,480
Let's let's do that.

57
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,250
So this is obviously the nab right.

58
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,390
It's kinsman's solids tarradiddle.

59
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,570
So I'm sure you are you comfortable with this navigation right.

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:41,010
The secret here is the detail that the secret here is how this hamburger menu this will item.

61
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,120
How does it represent the the actual man.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,050
How does it know.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
That's the thing.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,670
That's how it does is.

65
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,060
And he's into this deal.

66
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,390
We have this button and all these lines for a second third.

67
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,940
These are just the lines.

68
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,700
If you remove that save it and go and the first is lower.

69
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,570
So it just the line I can you.

70
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:17,880
So these ones they are inside this button and this button has the data toggle class and another target

71
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,050
and the target is this thing.

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,860
But for example number collapsed.

73
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,970
And that is exactly the same I.D..

74
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:34,270
Remember this hash tag we use for ID and this data we use for class processes.

75
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:44,900
So this button with this spend Marsch it's targeting the actual navigation which is this which is in

76
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,690
this deep.

77
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,470
And as you can see beares example net net collapse one.

78
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,380
And here is exactly the same.

79
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,690
So this is how it works.

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,110
This bottom how it how that's how it goes to control this one.

81
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:16,970
For simplicity let's say let's say in many senses is can gift you have made carbon copy and start again.

82
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:26,330
So let's send this to him Logan fix this border radius and let's fry them in live here.

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,970
This is pretty cool.

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,850
Border radios are a big.

85
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:43,610
It's Corbie this thing and let's put it inside our systems.
