1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,510
Either.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,530
We're going back to bootstrap to yet another video.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,980
And so far we did quite a lot.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,610
We have beautiful navigation.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,370
We have the images.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,800
Recently we did a bit of a I can box kind of thing.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,610
We have the list contact forms.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,550
And there are a lot more components you can use and you can always visit bootstrap and learn more about

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,050
them.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,930
But basically we going to go almost everything we did quite a lot.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,490
And so of the cool stuff I'm going to Carwin in two upcoming videos such as in this video I'm going

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,530
to cover how you can use scrolls spy.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,950
So what does that is.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,960
When we scroll like this is the services space in his basement but that's what it is.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,450
And this is a contact.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,240
So when he's calling what if we want to highlight this segment like if we are in the services sector

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,750
we want to highlight this and if we are in the contact six in our contact link and we want to highlight

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,290
this link.

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,640
So how do we do that.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,490
And know we can do that using scrolls 5 and that is super easy.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,250
So that's one of the amazing things.

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,810
So search for treasure

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,710
scrolls by

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,910
and we can go to official site or we can even go to those three schools there are quite a lot of useful

25
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,940
examples.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,920
And you know you can always come here for reference.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,990
Pretty good list for that.

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,160
And as you can see you can you can try it.

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,770
Select the section one and just scroll it goes 6 and B and so on and so on.

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,900
So how do we do that.

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,550
It's pretty let's.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,370
This is the examples of people trying to in order to have here

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,930
is this special class that I Spy and the name scrawled.

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,990
And what does it target this one targets the number.

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,950
So we have the navigation with the class name of nav bar.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,870
OK.

37
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:28,710
So as long as we have this class name for the navigation and inside this navigation we should have the

38
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:37,860
buildings obviously represent all the links that we want to have is great and that is all we need is

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:45,210
this bit of code that a spy school and that's target the name of the number is number.

40
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,830
So look let's copy it isn't

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
like two days.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,340
And as you can see at the moment it's suppressed nothing's happening.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,850
Doesn't matter where we are nothing's said.

44
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,490
Let's try.

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:12,310
So we're in our index corts DIMA all we need to do is you know our body into the body don't we need

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,720
to.

47
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,970
It's not a spike.

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,310
Scroll down to target number.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,960
So we have a number we targeting these navigation class.

50
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:29,030
So it automatically digs in with a page whichever deep we are on equal.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,610
So good typical first as you can see we are in the context of

52
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:52,450
writing about where in the about when the services were in the country and as we scroll and see the

53
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,340
it does seem pretty good right.

54
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,700
See the last deal.

55
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,540
The names for that the

56
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:13,210
date from and we don't have any link we can create another link for this one as if we want to lately.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,430
So this is how you can implement this beautiful feature.

58
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,230
Cool right.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,650
OK let's do some more cool stuff in the next video.

60
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,460
Thank you.
