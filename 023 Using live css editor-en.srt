1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,260
LET'S MAKE IT WAS AMAZING using these I can show you how you can do that.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,790
First thing let's let's put them inside the Jumbotron.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,960
So this deal that we are working with these icons.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:31,120
Let's give you the class name of the jumbotron and let's create a custom class that's for our use.

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,490
OK.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,910
I can I can I can.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,030
OK.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,890
So this is this has a class in all of them will turn.

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:48,120
And then we have given a different class name as well which we will use later to customize savey.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,050
Yes.

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,590
It has got the Jumbotron but we wanted to change the background color and do a bit of styling.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,240
So for that.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,310
Well I wouldn't do it.

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,740
It's always good if we can apply some CIRCE's and see live.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,480
See the action you know take effect live.

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,870
So for that there's a great plug in.

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,130
If you're using Google Chrome and I'll show that that's really useful.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,740
You sirs for live see is in your

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,470
is one of the Cormac's since you're there is I had this in so just wanted to show you.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,420
That's right.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,610
I could do it again.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:51,790
I just simply add to Chrome I extends and as you can see here this is the one we're working.

23
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:58,420
Now what we can do is we know this Jumbotron has a class name of items right.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,180
This is the one I give the counseling.

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:11,660
So let's let's use this and let's let's try this here please allow access to file.

26
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,020
You are.

27
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,370
Come on.

28
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,780
I love it.

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,600
These things can be a bit annoying sometimes.

30
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,160
All right that's great.

31
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,620
So we have all I can see you.

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,850
Let's play some studying so and I can swear.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,960
OK.

34
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:40,120
And then let's let's apply some styling and see see it happening real quick.

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,000
Background color.

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,710
I want to take color pick an extremely crude

38
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,050
color didn't want blue being a

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,150
maybe light maybe some sort of like background color.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,250
Look at that.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,630
It's beautiful isn't it.

42
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,180
All right that's good.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,900
I can actually lead them on.

44
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,800
All right.

45
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:30,010
Let's try this again now the problem is it's it's you know I want a bit of a margin here.

46
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,900
How do you do that.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,880
A margin top maybe 20 bucks.

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,010
Let's make it 50.

49
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,760
That's good.

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,140
And as you can see by default bootstrap has all these bar boards really radius these things.

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,310
And I want it to be completely rectangular and or not like that.

52
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,330
So you can do that.

53
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:05,210
You can remove that by using radios in general.

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:05,880
So

55
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:22,080
Budarin radius or tournaments with bootstrap is that it's a default to the behavior you need to overwrite.

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,280
Sometimes you can do that is using this important thing.

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,610
So as soon as you apply the important as you can see this Baldrige issue will be gone.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,500
As you continue to do this with services keep in mind you.

59
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,970
So we have beautiful.

60
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,320
Now let's make these items bigger.
