1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,490
Write it even for a second slide book

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,660
the

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,650
browse gallery for every second you're going to have different customized buttons and all the stuff

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,260
which is great.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,260
That's good.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,370
Let's go ahead and replace the images.

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,890
So we have the images here.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,800
I have downloaded some images.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,150
I will make the whole folder of ideas here you.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,960
So if you want to play and obviously can do source

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,630
images the programs should be easy to use.

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,020
The next images

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,910
source.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,620
Let's do it on the first.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,620
And this time let's use didn't need to.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,070
It is a beautiful lake in Nepal.

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,630
It is the next room.

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:14,010
Next is let's use the app.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,770
And meet this man.

20
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,920
So feel free to customize the text on the bottom and all the info we just did the images

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,290
you're

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,560
this is on top of our page.

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,170
Looks beautiful.

24
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,280
That's awesome.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,130
Again.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,870
You can customize the text buttons and all that just great.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,070
This freaks this bit of reading here.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,940
What does the name of calmness mean for you.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,610
Dave is my Kerrison we can begin use carrousel closeness.

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:24,710
Let's try to live curso Mars in bottom a piece of glass.

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,720
That's good.

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,430
Ken it was and so it's.

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,590
That's awesome.

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,330
Mike Scott it is.

35
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,090
It's good to see isn't and at this.

36
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:45,190
MARTIN So Miles and Burton do we have carrots and celery.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,600
No.

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,660
Know we have that and it's called

39
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,060
margin bottom six they already applied.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,120
So we applied let's make it simpler.

41
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:14,680
Austin what I want to make this land different especially in the course of a week or two doesn't apply.

42
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,870
So let's let's face that too.

43
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:28,040
It's good to be heading let's go to the class of Cairo so getting him

44
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,350
M.S. And let's apply the same class to all the headings

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:55,910
and Curson hating again cruller quite well looks pretty good actually.

46
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,670
The Sterling

47
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,280
interest because there we have it it's beautiful.

48
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:15,270
So this is how you can use words for as you can see you can achieve almost any lay out any any design

49
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,880
with such simplicity it's incredible.

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,520
Something happened here.

51
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:38,820
We don't need this 6N Let's get for the feature with all the feature and feature it is coming from here.

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:47,630
When we carpet this vision and this space has all the features things so this that styling is so obvious

53
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,190
here.

54
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:25,800
So one thing I noticed too is that it is the color was built or written and that was because they stenciled

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,380
with carpet.

56
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,380
It had this glass it was targeting the entire body section so a new jury.

57
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,800
So this is all we have.

58
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,340
This is all our own starting in the one we copied from there.

59
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,990
That's all on the carousel once we keep and everything else I delete it.

60
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:56,650
So I said Captain and everything with the carousel we need I get this feature.

61
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,190
We don't even need to and this is the last one we created by ourselves.

62
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,260
So just this one two three four five.

63
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,660
So these five was so silent you keep.

64
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:21,150
And secondly I could say with the first and looks of it it's looking really good.

65
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,870
And this is it for this listen I'll show you some of cool stuff.

66
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,620
And the next one.

67
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,480
Thank you very much.
