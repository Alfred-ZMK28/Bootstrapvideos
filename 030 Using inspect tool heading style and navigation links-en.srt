1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,900
You it's going to come in like this column see how beautiful it is.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,560
It's not that bright.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,900
That's right.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,240
So let's see if we call it it's.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,840
What is the actual name.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:23,100
So you can do that by going to inspect and then normally when you have when you hold her away you can

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,730
see that this content is active and you know this is EC2.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:36,570
And then they cut and again however she talks currently where we are in the right place.

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,660
This is the call I really like with this Kwabena.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,030
So that's how we get these girls to handle

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,930
get through this and they should have the send this one does reason.

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,600
And there were

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
extremely it's

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,390
not all going to be awkward.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,460
Sometimes it happens with words.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:29,540
So even though it's clear the new class is.

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,740
I to make it even bigger.

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,350
Well that's good.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,340
All right so this is how it is we have this man text.

20
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:54,710
Yeah.

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,660
We have this.

22
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,730
We have.

23
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,860
We have six and we have ordered list on wordless contact from Awesome.

24
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,170
OK so we were actually going to open the link again we did.

25
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:16,600
And now what do we have we have this let's make it let's make it so we C6 here.

26
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,410
You know

27
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,580
Mrs.

28
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:43,210
reunion is totally because it's so services offensive but even the point

29
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,120
and is so it lives over.

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:00,870
Let's give you the idea that he would go back to the menu.

31
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:11,040
So first we need to get to the content and services we get to the services.

32
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,060
And when you scroll over as you have noticed the menu disappears we can keep it always on top.

33
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,760
We can do that by just going to a menu.

34
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:29,370
It that it was never fixed.

35
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,520
Don't.

36
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,880
That's the classic.

37
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,120
No.

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,540
It always stays on don't you.

39
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,910
All right.

40
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,810
Contact me in the contact room services when the service is about or.

41
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,540
Let's make this six in about right.

42
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:59,570
These is this a good idea.

43
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,050
And Bob

44
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,280
All right.

45
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:21,000
Which services the men been good about this about services contact.

46
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,880
Or is it this case and learn how to have links to our menu.

47
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,930
And we did a bit of a sighting do and we'll do more in the next list.

48
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,390
Thank you.
