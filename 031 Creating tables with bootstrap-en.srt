1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,900
Are to going to use tables it's really easy to use tables and bootstrap

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,200
after the contact form.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,620
Dig deep.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,100
It's.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,710
Common.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,060
It's good idea to come and come to you to come back later on and you know not to get confused

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,870
to

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,620
do this.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,260
The men do.

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,220
So did you know

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,070
do 10

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,490
do to

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,520
maybe do some

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,460
creative

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:28,360
terms to do and then heading heading What do you want.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,060
In the.

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,450
That's for the heading that's create a boarded up team.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,330
Devil did the roof.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,490
So wrong.

20
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,090
It was same as the Butcher roll all the way from right to left and then columns.

21
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,360
So this one is 0 and headings did.

22
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,820
So I mean it skewed one

23
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,510
image in one and

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,800
the contact index

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,660
string.

26
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:40,400
Mr..

27
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,310
Yeah.

28
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,820
There you have it.

29
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,320
It's what can we do to make it better.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,810
When you say those are terrible I don't believe betting it's that good.

31
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,160
And let's clear some more data to let go of it versus

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,620
fresh.

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,310
Yes.

34
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,320
Got some data this year with a background background Jumbotron.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:22,160
And my question is it for Lance to contain Jim Butler was beer

36
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,730
good.

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah that looks good.

38
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,450
It's a bit of a bad thing to do.

39
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,840
It would be devil.

40
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,070
This is my last network.

41
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,010
It's different from

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,180
my entire picture.

43
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,080
Really easy and beautiful to wait tables in extra.

44
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,290
I get so good that we got there and we got there getting things done.

45
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,980
We created a little

46
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,270
crap table for it.

47
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,750
Are we nearly done with the book.

48
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
So we did quite a lot of things.

49
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,970
What are some cool things I want to show you like adding full with background images.

50
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,660
And probably I want to show you how you can apply the gradient color very background not just the solid

51
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,830
and looks really amazing and you will see in the future lessons.

52
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,260
Thank you.
