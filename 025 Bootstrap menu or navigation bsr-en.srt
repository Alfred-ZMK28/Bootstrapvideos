1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,930
This and I will see how you can use with some navigation menu bar on top.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,140
So it's good to bootstrap with the official side.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:24,730
And so just search for both navigation and let's go to the site and let's go to dokes.

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,320
To.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,040
Let's use this this navigation has everything forms drubbed everything.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,390
And we will remove the good nature.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,790
This is the complete code.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,020
Sits inside that tag and then it has a contained a fluid.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,280
It has a deal with all these bars which is simply the hamburger menu when the menu gets more from mobile

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,290
devices.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:57,590
And then we have the desex and all the links the and the writer of the net by all these links Let's

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
go over this and break it down.

13
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:01,520
Groby

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:10,320
And right after the board is done let's proceed.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,440
The first thing let's let's save it and see how it looks.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:35,030
And friends and there is it's looks pretty good.

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,840
We didn't need this from let's get rid of that.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,940
So where is that from that.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,800
That is it is six.

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,470
Yeah.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:02:00,740
And this from where the name is let's remove these.

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,450
And let's keep only this I really really want this.

23
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,000
Well some of the

24
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,740
who this leftside job done let's get rid of it.

25
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,400
It's good to have it again.

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,780
You know these links I want links to be here.

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,490
Let's fix that up.

28
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,370
So what we have here is obviously we started our navigation here.

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,770
Never said that this is the next day in day.

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,160
Most important one from the biggest one is how to use this.

31
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,130
And then this is using the night class and it's the default.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,210
Never.

33
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:12,350
We can't even send this to the universe and then the universe will look like this black default will

34
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,820
look white.

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,630
Let's keep it like again.

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,120
So the next thing.

37
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:28,330
So this is I showed you this works for the mobile screen like as you go inside and go smaller as you

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,100
can see the the menu collapses and becomes hamburger menu.

39
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,640
That's that's Teigen that that's for those I can sample.

40
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,530
These ones are going to let's leave them there.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,830
And then there's another dig this deep has honored at least this one.

42
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,020
We didn't want this on this on the left side.

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,980
So let's get rid of that.

44
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:06,760
So we have that on our list and it has lists you first list and second list in your second list has

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,400
a drop down.

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,650
So inside this list has many other things to like.

47
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,520
This is the first list this one has one link.

48
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,090
And then again another on our list starts.

49
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,220
It is a drop down menu and then it has all these options.

50
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,080
Save it and see how it works.

51
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,560
So we have the link.

52
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
We have just done.

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,340
And then we have one let's get dropped on that we wouldn't really want them.

54
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,880
However I would take some of these links Cobi.

55
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:49,430
And then let's remove this from let's move on and let's keep it simple let's just keep some things and

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,060
we'll make them clickable.

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,640
OK so this is the for the hamburger menu.

58
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,260
Little icons look three lines.

59
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:10,540
And this is the the usual one when this new service or brand in this next house.

60
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:20,410
So let's let's repeat this thing and it's been made of or and probably are making small should.

61
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,990
Well in the screen.

62
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,680
OK so we started with the navigation bar.

63
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,270
We give them a class name of inversed and we have first dibs again this deal contains everything you

64
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,220
see is cynicism.

65
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,160
Right before the knife so this container fluid fluid because it is stretching all the way from right

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,100
to left.

67
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,150
So that's there and inside that deal we have this deal.

68
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,930
This deal is mainly for this I can.

69
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,790
The collapse I can get to so that's that that's that's good.

70
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:03,250
And then the many all we have is this it's this this is how you can leave comments in his team.

71
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,340
I think so it's pretty straightforward.

72
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,150
Let me show you this exclamation mark does this.

73
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,880
And then there's those clues.

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,170
So in-between everything you write will be discarded and it will have no effect in the code.

75
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,490
Again

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,460
this is our bootstrap mania.

77
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,420
Your navigation do this header with items and then mentally.

78
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,990
This is where we have to deal with the collapse Nabat collapse.

79
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:51,170
And this is the idea which responds to this city.

80
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:59,360
It sent this idea and this is and that's how it works when it goes to the small screen size.

81
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,760
That's how it works.

82
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,540
And then we have these links on our list we created and then we have the following things link.

83
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,490
And then about

84
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,280
services.

85
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,570
All right.

86
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,910
Looks like we are in one of them.

87
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:38,290
So we have to fix bigger bedding here and then and then let's make it responsive.

88
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,600
So we have this button.

89
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:46,250
But if it doesn't work and we'll fix that to that's do today.

90
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,460
So we have to link that as well so I will show you how to do that in the next list.

91
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,340
So I hope it is pretty straightforward to understand.

92
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,690
So of course only this month.

93
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,460
Now you read was a lot with my son and this makes the navigation.
