1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,900
OK I'm sure you're having a great time.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,340
Practical bootstrap again and all these things you learn you can apply it to real life.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,520
And this is this is what you need to know.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,610
We give the slider good background in all this scrolling effect.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:31,840
Now that you can see the grading slowly goes from dark black to fade and fading away like that looks

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,510
really awesome.

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,290
You can see such background with gradient if it looks really fantastic.

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,510
So how do you achieve that.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:51,340
Let's let's use the slogan slightly faded car looks awesome let me see the view pencil's actually let's

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,420
see the inspect.

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,330
And as you can see done with some.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,380
I give it a class name of what you want.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,820
And this is what I use Lynagh brilliant.

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,100
Right.

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,660
So let me just copy this

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:18,490
Corbin's and then come back to my site and you can get that where it says is creating.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,130
This is very true.

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,460
Just by Googling and born here they have pretty good example.

19
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,310
See you see all these actually were done reason looks pretty good.

20
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,790
But for the table I think black and white looks fine.

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,420
So you can see all these and they have different styling applied so that it works works well for the

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,720
old browsers for Firefox for us or for him.

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,360
So if he encounters some problem in Mozambique and hopefully other browsers will support but if not

24
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,370
there's a fix.

25
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,040
So as you can see with we'll throw it away with all this but on nearly all passengers sometimes this

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,770
happens some browser works well some eyebrows done.

27
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,120
So what it does is does work it does.

28
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,230
This is falsified.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,740
And everything else is same as a linear gradient.

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,330
All this everything is same but for specific browsers there are certain name on up with this new standard.

31
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,080
Hopefully you will have to this it's quite a headache.

32
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,940
This is for Safari Wickett all they use for opera modes they use for Mozilla Firefox and so hopefully

33
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,820
I don't have to do all this yet.

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:50,980
So these Divx which give you the name of it and then add another Gerns gradient.

35
00:02:51,170 --> 00:03:01,910
You know in his first news biz It was then that he

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,130
guess because we use words on its head and back.

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,130
Ms.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,570
Klans instead here and we have the table from Austin so we can use this to the table.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,070
So

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:36,200
from us so as you can see we can add background radian background which is pretty cool.

41
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,220
You just want to say call up.

42
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,830
I don't have a problem with this.

43
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:50,320
This is code which is slightly x x x x y

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,220
and

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,510
word said danger

46
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,660
or nodes straight.

47
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,350
That's awesome.

48
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:20,710
This is this is just to say use the phrase Buderim

49
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,420
making great.
