1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,980
I guess I'll say it is looking really good.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,620
And we have a lot of we cover a lot of things aren't really wonderful things.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:17,740
It's called panels and they're really cool and released lists we did at least we did so let the bands.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,490
They are really cool.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,010
And then and then we go from there.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,720
And people that just want to say one thing sometimes you must have noticed the sun takes like Count

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,740
ball in how they do that and we discover that insects and to so I keep forgetting that.

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:41,820
Let me say so let's go with sex and so this is how the world is this year.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,940
And let's say I want to highlight some of the text and it's good for Search Engine Optimization too

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,810
not just for looks good and it works well.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,240
For the broadest search engine says.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,980
So let's say when we ring the bell somebody we need to highlight.

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:09,070
So what we can do is we can use the strong to strong currency and that's me strong.

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,130
And then they go and you put the text inside.

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,230
So this makes the text board.

16
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,750
See the textbook we can achieve the same effect using B.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,150
We didn't really use it.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,480
I haven't really seen this drag being used.

19
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,260
We get the same effect but Haubegger strong is recommended for Search Engine Optimization that is really

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,120
good.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,230
And here let me show you this.

22
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,150
When you use it all the text text gets it that.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,080
And there is one more thing in the registry and there it is the real problem and you will always use

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,310
this term there.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,450
So just keep that in mind strong.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,430
And sometimes we can create a blank course as well.

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,050
Blockquote

28
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,970
you before I forget to say the

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:27,070
this is the program but let's say I want to highlight this bit of text as a block quote I get to come

30
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,650
and see.

31
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:37,360
Let me clear this b c you could never put anything inside this blockquote again.

32
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,880
See what happens.

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,930
It doesn't look really good in things because we were central to that text.

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,200
But

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,250
it doesn't that good

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,460
it again so one thing someday.

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,290
Thankfully.

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,100
So did you.

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,650
I was a bit forgetting that for you let me create a new deal at the end.

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,920
Do you

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,470
an do contain B or

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,460
you didn't copy paste this.

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,250
Oh that's probably because I'm wrapping it inside.

44
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:54,240
P let me wrap it and said this is do this the better for the better.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,660
Now this is also the program.

46
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,180
However this is a book called

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,420
purity from see that these are words.

48
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:14,680
So sometimes it really gives the dynamics that is needed to your articles and it's really cool.

49
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,320
All right so this is how you can create blockquote is just cool.

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,260
So we cover strong tracks and block art and design and our core.

51
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,700
I was going to cost them something else and that's when we had the panels panels.

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,270
Excellent.

53
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,740
Thank you.
