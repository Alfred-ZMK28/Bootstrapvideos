1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,570
So said is look awesome.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:13,680
Let's add a 5:56 in as well in the food in the closing of our contained inside this.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,920
Let's create the same as the inadvertence of a word.

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,790
And then that's right.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,740
Copyright.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:35,820
And if you were to read copyrights and you can do and you you're being way copyright

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,100
in your

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:01,440
freezer word conservative to where I think you get this character is on top of you should enter key

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,720
on your key word or phrase.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,190
And there we have it.

11
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,390
And as you can see the copy or the copyright I can that looks like that.

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,280
So there are some special characters you have to write like this and all is well how to write code how

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,530
to write a certain characteristic you might need to know and that you can quickly search and Google

14
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,370
can get things done.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,290
So footer Let's hope it is let's put them aside.

16
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,940
Deal with the class.

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,630
Richard in

18
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,600
this footer.

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,680
This is for the his team and Michael this is for the standard.

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:51,380
We are following for Search Engine Optimization and this division just for the design this is for to

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,050
get the bootstrap design.

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:00,110
However this is the actual His In a market that is necessary for the proper housing base.

23
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,610
So you always put further nonfinite finish Legation and all that stuff.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,650
But the rest of it all the deals.

25
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,860
They're just all styling bubbles.

26
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:16,390
Let's let's use the Jumbotron glass looks pretty good.

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:16,930
JIM

28
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,350
Yeah that looks beautiful.

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,990
That's very good for future also.

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,720
We did quite a lot.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,580
What else we can do with future is just so good I just can't stop me.

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,940
Feel like doing more and more let's do this.

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,950
Art subregional I want to add a background image.

34
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,370
Obviously we have vision but this is a slider.

35
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:54,000
But I want to show you why and how to use the background fully with background images and on top of

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,840
that we will have probably services that so I'll show you that how you can do it in the next video.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,280
Thank you.
