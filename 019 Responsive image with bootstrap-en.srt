1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,990
It's good to be working with bootstrap

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,460
the next thing we want to do is you know that's how we use them this year.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,910
I'm another maybe heading to.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,150
And then we'll have the means and maybe we'll have some direction on the one side and image on the other.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,360
So we need to clubs right before on the heading.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,630
We did one call right here we want the half of the square and we went in and another half we on decks.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,840
So how do we do that.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,560
Pretty good.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,490
We'll try to get squared heads to

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,750
heads to get this deal.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,630
Let's leave it.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,910
Let's start with another Dave.

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,650
So you can feel free to create as many days as it is.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,350
It's pretty good.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,930
It's a good practice like it did and this time also we create a column called small

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,640
so we create another deal with the whole world.

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,730
And then this time we want to have two six inch two columns.

18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,300
Right.

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:32,920
Let's create called six then let's create another one.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,870
So what I've done here instead of this deal with the 12 call that is the maximum 12 column allowed again.

21
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,060
So instead of we created six and six.

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,020
So it always has to talk to.

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,640
OK.

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,180
Either way it doesn't render properly if we create one with the six and one with little three.

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,450
It would be total 9.

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,560
So it doesn't read properly so always make sure you you totally to truck.

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,520
You can even create 4 4 4.

28
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,690
So trade deals and in total 12.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,930
So that's how it works.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,940
Always make it to 12 weeks and the first day.

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,150
I want to put it in this.

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,000
So let me bring

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,640
the images to our folder first.

34
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,470
We had used images.

35
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:39,530
Let's bring this full term currency and we are just one of these images we can use

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,940
images.

37
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:51,420
So would serve has in his class as well for Responsive EMIs.

38
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,160
So it is responsive for that cost.

39
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:08,080
Obviously we just grid images tight and then we give it a class name of E-Myth response.

40
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,060
That's what Strub glistening.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,870
It make the Lewis-Francis.

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:22,410
Now the source is in Mrs. fooler with the name of the.

43
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:31,330
You say that we heard the side of an all day let's call it.

44
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,760
E-mail us at recruits

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,250
and be mean.

46
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,370
It for us.

47
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:56,920
And as you can see it's in the hall of the first call which they call them small six beautiful 5:51

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,310
and we can write decks with the texture and it is beautifully Pressman's you don't need to worry about

49
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,940
that.

50
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,670
We must have who then say hi to this and say This works perfectly.

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,990
It sits inside this deal and just pretty responsive.

52
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:23,240
I added some text to call them it's good heads to head into it.

53
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:38,100
There's no way you really are going to learn to make me look beautiful and the words do x.

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,030
Like you say read the chapter and verse.

55
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,890
And as you can see we've got the Tardieu and the text you're.
