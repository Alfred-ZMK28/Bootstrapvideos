1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:08,740
Again so one thing we're going to do with book 7 that is adding Karev so carelessly is the image slider

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,040
which is really popular these days.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,590
People see a lot of words as hair on top of the page in the landing base.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,680
The image is lighter which is really cool and it's really easy to implement that with bootstrap.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,320
Let's go up soles for boots for our cars.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,900
Let's go to the other side.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,870
Kirsten Temperley boots from

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,370
this is how it looks.

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:47,300
So we have the the button we can have some takes some paragraphs and descriptions and we have these

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,440
items pretty cool.

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,830
So this is the carousel and beggar obviously we can have images instead of this blank thing.

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,730
So how do we implement that.

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,580
Because sometimes all you have to do to get things like this and this is not just for bootstrap on the

14
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:16,810
Internet you can see certain things in many different websites and you might want to implement the same

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,550
same feature same functionality.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,910
How do you do that.

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:27,550
Most of the time you can simply do that by you know applying the same CIRCE's scripts same styling where

18
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,390
they would use.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,080
So how do you do that by just right clicking and pusilla pays Pacer's.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:46,240
And as you can see the whole biz is generated by these code again.

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:53,640
So the carousel begins here on the top with just the navigation navigation navigation.

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,310
So after that they have Carrousel.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,790
So this is what we are interested in and simply we can copy this code on this copy does and of course

24
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,410
of course it is

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,530
and here.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,060
Right after the navigation navigation and this carousel

27
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,870
again.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,450
And so

29
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,250
they've now landed just like

30
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,830
quite a lot but I'll explain pretty pretty straight forward.

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,010
So it begins with the DB.

32
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,570
It doesn't deal with it we give it a class name of Carousel carousel and then slide so it does slide.

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,780
And Dr. Hardcastle the default class name defaults name for this dog.

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,680
And they have active state.

35
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:17,320
They have the images and it sends it's lived for the moment and the man heading and some description

36
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,690
can always override this one to shoot you need.

37
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,400
And then there is a button with important private plans and yet the mental images are there.

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,680
This is the image.

39
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,120
This is this third image is

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:43,850
and so on and this is the I can use they use the cliff I can but we're going to use Formosan instead.

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,420
You really change that.

42
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,880
And this is pretty much it.

43
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,630
Let's start with some images but before that let's have a look at save it and have a look in our site.

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,580
It looks you don't see it.

45
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,540
David

46
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,520
probably will need to get the census as well.

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,550
Let's go to the door.

48
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,940
They always have the you know the headsets and they have this you have yet carousel that she has they

49
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,500
have.

50
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,370
So let's let's get this entire series in or modify it.

51
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,490
You copy and it's going to tell us uses that space.

52
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,770
We don't need all these things on Bombo size of Carousel cartilages.

53
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,320
Let's see this.

54
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,690
Let's listen.

55
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,270
Three zoos

56
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,170
sell hives fixed to 500.

57
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,990
That's good.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,260
But we didn't intend that.

59
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,910
We have our own.

60
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,170
Let's get this

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,880
so customized by six and we just deleted and the Kerrison let's leave it.

62
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,460
So get us a base class.

63
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,900
There are some serious issues with Disney Aircel item.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,450
Email is they're doing all the hard work marketing content with this.

65
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,530
We can get rid of it.

66
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
That is for the entire business that we saw early on to implement some of those kids obviously feel

67
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,530
free to do that.

68
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,470
Features as you know alternate is that Kerrison thing.

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,750
Let's play it for a moment.

70
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,390
Two threads and as you can see we have the Council of biddable.

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,050
We need to fix this bit of a padding Otherwise it looks pretty neat.
