1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,690
Get started it's let me open up my text editor.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,360
OK so we created index file and here.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,260
So this is our biggest.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,860
Hello world and some stuff let's go with that first we need to degrade Dr.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,120
head and insert head six and it's quite

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,920
stra and it's quite boring.

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,210
You know we need to link all this see a ceasefire so let's get a link.

8
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:00,930
So we are going to think here see as his services for seniors is

9
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:13,510
we'll a policy that says we should be ready to start using will triple-X dried out so would show how

10
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,560
it works is we create the first thing we create is a container div.

11
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,560
It's good idea.

12
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:30,370
And then inside indeed we created a class called contenta.

13
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,670
This is a strip class.

14
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm just making it up.

15
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,300
This is the butcher class and using whatever it it's all about using their their class name.

16
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,790
So they had they had different writers Their them and we used that to argue what are we trying to achieve.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,280
And we can obviously read more about it in official site.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,670
However this discourse prevailed for all that because it can be overwhelming in the beginning.

19
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,170
So you'll be good with me.

20
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,970
And then later on THE NEXT go more obviously.

21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,270
So the first thing you want to do is clear deal with the container.

22
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,520
So inside this container we will put everything into the world you want first is we need to create a

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,540
role for us not to deal with the class of Roe.

24
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,870
And so Roy is like like I'm all the way from right to left.

25
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,230
Now inter-sex that's true.

26
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:36,360
So inside Roe we might want many sex and we might want one two three many sex and so gay would set rules

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:46,940
are Rose must be be our must have total of 12 Kolb's 12 Quillen.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,390
That's what they call it.

29
00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:01,270
So inside Roe we can create columns we can create one column and give it class name of call them small

30
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,680
talk like that.

31
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,700
So this is the most basic of bootstrap.

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,820
You create a can deal with the content.

33
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:18,290
And then that is really the main content of that whole everything inside this company you'll create

34
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,040
a row and you can have many rows.

35
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:29,750
So we create the first row and we want to have some content inside there so that our content will have

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,880
the full width pro-coal we can't have more than 12 column in one row.

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,940
What we can have meaning small columns that really are total to true.

38
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,630
So if you don't want just one column of 12 you can create many but we'll come back to that later.

39
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,720
OK so this is the so called them small tool.

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,830
It all worked beautifully for us and on the screen as well.

41
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,360
And later I will show you again that medium and large and I'll show you how that was too.

42
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,360
So to start with.

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,020
Let's let's try something here.

44
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,030
Let's ride Hatoum

45
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:23,170
low or save it and let's try it out let's open this browser.

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,840
And as you can see.

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
Hello world.

48
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,560
Because we are already using bootstrap.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,260
You can see the different the different looks with different ways of bootstrap specific font.

50
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,310
And you can see for batting on the left side and all this.

51
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,950
So we have already used words for.
