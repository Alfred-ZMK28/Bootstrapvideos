1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,950
Want to make it through to be able to use the Google ordinary Go for it.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,410
Yes.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,030
Let's open up our folder.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:27,990
We have used this and this open with something in the world because the word we used in has to be so

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:28,920
cool.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,350
So I'm going to finally get it right now.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,330
It's in Birdie's

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,380
head had.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,570
So we got this phone to use Barina.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,530
Now let's go right here and that's.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:01:02,390
That has to do is make heads and heads do goods give them the Marine

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,900
said.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
That's just.

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,180
It doesn't look that great but pretty cool.

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,770
What we can do is let's make them

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,920
I want to make them bigger and we can even use inline style.

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:43,180
Sometimes it's really handy in case I'm like now we can use this bring it down.

18
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,250
Read.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,100
So let's add in started they form

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,680
form search

21
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,400
on sizes maybe 50 books.

22
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,660
Make a nice big beautiful Gondek 456

23
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,370
or this.

24
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,010
That's me.

25
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,340
All one has to fit it.

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,770
We get one size fits.

27
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:40,950
Just give them the color and sort of thing what that all that we can take some interesting code with

28
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,350
try this.

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,990
This Inori.
