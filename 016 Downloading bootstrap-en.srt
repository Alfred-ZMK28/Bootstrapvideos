00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,610
Hello and welcome back to the section in the section we're going to learn bootstrap in the previous

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:16,080
section we did a bit of a hasty immanency assist we learn how to use styling paddings and the basic

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,560
stuff.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:25,770
But we're going to go to bootstrap now and to begin with what we will do is we will try to use bootstrap

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:33,870
on this space and see the difference because this is this really old school and you don't want to be

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,430
real.

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,980
So we have such a structure it looks it doesn't look right.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:48,570
So we can use bootstrap in what would serve itsay has him and his team are CSSA and javascript's framework

9
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,630
for building responsive mobile first projects on the web.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,710
So without further ado let's get started.

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:05,280
First thing you want to do is download books ready to go to get bootstrapped dot com and you can download

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,580
bootstrap from there.

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,820
And just click the button and download it.

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,600
I've downloaded so I'm going to show you from a distance.

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,110
Or we can even use the N word.

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:28,140
I think we'll come back to it later she didn't simply means that instead of let me show you just the

17
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:36,160
previous one it's better you will understand the style set with it here.

18
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,910
So this is how we defined in this small style set.

19
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,210
So this is how you can use bootstrap.

20
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:51,790
You can download the dirty faces and then you can link to your main page just like this in the head

21
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,200
section and that's all we can do.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,750
But another option is to use CD and it simply means the content delivery network.

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,770
And if you use this one you can still use wood.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,620
The thing is you don't need to download bootstrap locally and do all that stuff do it will automatically

25
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,330
work from the CDN and it is pretty good.

26
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:24,060
It's fast and it's perfect for the web so once you're ready to push it to the production but for development

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:33,580
Poppas it's always good to download and work with that lets down down the download and once you have

28
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,020
that ready we can start using it.

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:50,240
So here in my distro I created a folder called Bootstrap and I have downloaded the answer here.

30
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,790
So let me double click to extract it and I don't need this.

31
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm in the mood to try and here in so you can see we have siestas farms and javascript.

32
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,920
It all comes as a bundle with bootstrap and bootstrap has it.

33
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,130
I can say with this glyph icons.

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,600
But when I'm going to use that we're going to use front of font or some guidance with the most popular

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,390
one and that's the one you see most of the people using So we'll use that.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,470
Let's move it to crest and Zabol screwed.

37
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,230
We need javascript.

38
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,710
And then she says you can see we have many versions where many failed version which is good for production

39
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,430
but you can even use like I said before you can use the CD and so on.

40
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:55,620
Is this bootstrap would strap dirt insisted on we need we we don't mean.

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,770
I mean if I had more trust and let's give the team and that's what they said were more to trust.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,830
So it seems right now we have CIRCE's and we have showpieces and most of the clergy is in those groups

43
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,020
who have the votes of those.

44
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:23,330
So what I'm going to do now is copy these files and put it here and get rid of this for us.

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,740
So we have a folder inside this photo.

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,020
He says that was when you were ready to start working on our project so close this

47
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:46,750
and instead let me drag this folder would send the one I just created and let me remove this folder

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:58,150
from because it was so we had bootstrap folders in default we just showed a system that was downloaded.

49
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:10,050
And let me create one indexed hosting.

50
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,950
So in the next lesson we will start using bootstrap and what are we going to do is we're going to redo

51
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,070
the site that we did earlier.

52
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,340
This one we're going to use book 7 try to make it beautiful and pull your response as you can see this

53
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:34,360
is not corresponds to the image gets caught out on the screen gets smaller and all that.

54
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,930
So you we'll all be good with words.

55
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,150
And also in the next next video.

56
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,590
Thank you.
